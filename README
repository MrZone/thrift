Introduction
============

Thrift is a lightweight, language-independent RPC mechanism.  

Requirements
============
Thrift requires Python 2.4 or greater and PLY, the python LALR generator tool, 1.7 or greater.
See python.org for source and binary distributions for python
See http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html for the PLY distribution and documentation 

Thrift requires boost shared pointers from boost-1.33.1 or greater, see http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm

Resources
=========

Acknowledgments
===============

Thrift was inspired by pillar, a lightweight RPC tool written by Adam D'Angelo

INSTALLATION
============

If you are building from the first time out of the source repository, you will need to generate the configure scripts.  From the top directory, do:

	./bootstrap.sh

Once the configure scripts are generated, thrift can be configured.  From the top directory, do:

	./configure

You may need to specify the locacation of the boost files explicitly:   If you installed boost in  /usr/local, you would run configure as follows:

	./configure --with-boost=/usr/local

Note that by default the thrift C++ library is built with no debugging symbols included. If you would like debugging symbols during development work, run:

        ./configure --CFLAGS='-g -O2'

Run ./configure --help to see other configuration options

Make thrift 

	make

From the top directory, become superuser and do:

	make install

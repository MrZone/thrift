Introduction
============

Thrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack with an
associated code generation mechanism for RPC.

Requirements
============
Thrift requires boost shared pointers from boost-1.33.1 or greater,
see http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm

Resources
=========

More information about Thrift can be obtained on the Thrift webpage at:

Acknowledgments
===============

Thrift was inspired by pillar, a lightweight RPC tool written by Adam D'Angelo

INSTALLATION
============

If you are building from the first time out of the source repository, you will
need to generate the configure scripts.  From the top directory, do:

	./bootstrap.sh

Once the configure scripts are generated, thrift can be configured.
From the top directory, do:

	./configure

You may need to specify the location of the boost files explicitly.
If you installed boost in  /usr/local, you would run configure as follows:

	./configure --with-boost=/usr/local

Note that by default the thrift C++ library is built with no debugging symbols
included. If you would like debugging symbols during development work, run:

        ./configure CFLAGS='-g -O2'

Run ./configure --help to see other configuration options

Make thrift 

	make

From the top directory, become superuser and do:

	make install

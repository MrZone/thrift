THRIFT v0.01

Some time soon this document will tell you all about Thrift, what it does, how
it was designed, oh and some other stuff too. But in the meantime, all it does
is tell you that Thrift is the 2nd coming of Pillar, originally written by
the great Adam D'Angelo, and now manned mainly by mcslee and aditya at
facebook.com.

Oh yeah... a few rules:

1) This shit is open source. Don't mess.

2) Mark Slee is anal about coding standards and commenting, especially because
   this is open source. Again, don't mess.

3) You need three things to make a few. Otherwise call it a couple.

That's all.
